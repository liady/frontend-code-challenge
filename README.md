* Pay attention to software design and clean code (We are believers of the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principals). 
* We also care about things like readability, maintainability, naming, and in general everything that makes the code easy to understand and extend. **Think about the app as it should be ready to be shipped to production.**
* You are free to add any libraries of your desire. 

Don't hesitate to contact us with any question.
